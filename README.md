# CodeCast

This plugin allows you cast what you code and highlights to a Code Cast server. 
Its very useful when you have to explain code to someone.

When they connect will see the code in a prety format provided by AceEditor.
For the moment the client is viewing the code in readonly mode.
Even if they remove the readonly mode the server is not sending nothing to your SublimeText plugin.

# Setup

Download the server from here: [CodeCast Server](https://github.com/mraiur/CodeCastServer)
